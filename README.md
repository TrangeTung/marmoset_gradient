# marmoset_gradient
Marmoset gradient and its dynamics

Software (Windows system):
MATLAB R2020a & ITK-SNAP version 3.8.0

Main processing codes were listed in the folder "/main_custom_code/".

Example file
1. The retrograde SC (and log view) of marmoset
2. Gene expression similarity matrix of marmoset neuromodulatory receptors
3. Example BOLD fMRI time series (The dynamic FCs were derived using the DCC approach) 
[SC, structural connectivity; FC, functional connectivity]

Code involves modules:
1. marmoset functional gradients of ION and NIH dataset
2. marmoset structural gradients derived from retrograde SC
3. Gradient dynamics with arousal fluctuations
4. full GLM and reduced model, combined with gradient analysis
5. Unique contribution of neuromodulatory receptors
